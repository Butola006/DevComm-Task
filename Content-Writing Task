If the Cold War had escalated into a full-scale nuclear conflict, the global geopolitical landscape would have been drastically altered. The immediate effects would have included global devastation, with nuclear explosions leveling cities and contaminating the environment with radioactive fallout. For example, major U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago would have been reduced to rubble, while Russia's capital Moscow and other major cities would have suffered similar fates. The nuclear winter scenario would have led to a significant drop in global temperatures, disrupting food production and causing widespread famine. The global economy would have collapsed, leading to widespread poverty and instability. The aftermath would have likely led to a reshaping of the global political order, with surviving nations rebuilding and reorganizing. 

The long-term effects would have included environmental damage, causing genetic mutations, cancer, and other health issues for generations to come. The U.S. and Russia, as the two superpowers at the heart of the Cold War, would have been devastated, with their global influence and power significantly diminished. The world would have been left with a power vacuum, potentially leading to the rise of new regional powers and a more multipolar international system.
